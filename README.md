# baobab
project

This is more a project for a friend of mine, she is a baker, and i like her initiative, she wants to help a community in Malawi.
The community will be helped with food, clothes, she was even a teacher there for a while and she is really involved.

UX

This website is for people to buy and eat cake( gluten free even vegan) and all of the will be donated to a community in Malawi, Africa.
In order to get more people buying cake, i had add her facebook and instagram to it and it also have a link to her official site, where you can donate.
This Website is like a gateway for people to get to know her and help her. https://www.rbsbackherbusiness.co.uk/dogoodclub?fbclid=IwAR29qTIFhHMADUynfvH7TNLCxBN4S_O3ZrcuoxVPy-3P5v0rIGcR3u_Ux24
The main image in the index i took from Google, as the footer image, and the cakes are hers, and the photos in the community are actually kids from Malawi that she worked with.

Features

This project has 2 main files 
 -the index file which is more cake related as i have displayed some caked that she made ( i had tried a few, amaizing)
 -the community file which has a few photos with the kids there, you can see more on the original site and the reason why she does it

 Some other features are the hub section which will soon to be her caffe if all goes right, and we also have a link to her official site
 In the future i hope i can improve and make a more stunning website and maybe help a a lot more just by people visiting the website.

 Technologies

It mostly run on templates that i took from https://www.w3schools.com/ . With very little css as w3schools got most of it covered and with basic html that i used .
It also has a slideshow that i also took from w3schools and you can see that in the community file which runs as a script that uses Javacript.
It has 3 icons that i took from fontawesome. https://fontawesome.com/  You can find them in the community file.

Testing

The project runs alright on laptop, but i think on the phone it has a slight uphand as you can see it maybe better on phone.
Some of the bugs where when i tried to make normal changes on css like event text color and it would not change.
It is easy to read for the user and i think it is really simple. The most impact the user will have when they see  the community photos, were are displayed the kids just enjoying any atention.
The main page is easy to acces and you can come back to it any time you press on it
The contact page it opens a different tab, so the user can come back to the page if he decides he will not go forward with it.
the caffe page is just a simple page with a background photo and the logo, witch i plan to improve in the future, maybe as well as the whole website.
In the footer you can find her link to her social media such as Facebook and Instagram.
